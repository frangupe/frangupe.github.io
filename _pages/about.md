I am a Software Engineer at Amazon and a Computer Science student at State University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english)).

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist/Engineer for an AI-powered Digital Marketing startup, where I primarily led data-driven initiatives while also undertaking Software Engineering tasks. Additionally, I worked as a researcher, focusing on Digital Identity and Blockchain for IoT Devices.

During my undergraduate studies, I pursued multiple master-level courses in Machine Learning, Data Processing, Algorithms Optimization, and Cryptography. My primary personal and professional interests revolve around Machine Learning, Finance, Technology, and their intersections.
